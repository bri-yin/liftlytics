// The purpose of this view is to create a history of previously completed workouts, with timestamps. There will be options to sort by date, month, year, and even by workout template name. Upon clicking a workout there should be detailed analytics based on starting point and current workouts under the same template. Clicking the exercise in here will give an exercise progression graph.

struct WorkoutHistoryView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Text(/*@START_MENU_TOKEN@*/"Hello, World!"/*@END_MENU_TOKEN@*/)
    }
}
