 As a user I want to be able to:
 
 Phase 1:
 
 Create an exercise, e.g. Bench Press
 Save the exercise to a list of global exercises
 Exercises can be added to workouts with a set and rep range to aim for
 
 Workouts can be saved with a name and be seen on the homescreen
 Workouts can be started and tracked set by set
 Workouts can be viewed through history also on main screen
