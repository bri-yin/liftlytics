 So basically, to create this I need to decide how the flow works
 
 Exercises are an exercise name
 
 Workouts are comprised of exercises, sets, and reps
 
 Exercise and sets and reps = what you can use to track progressive overload
 
 So an exercise can be added to a workoutplan, and the workoutplan needs to be able to access previous exercise reps and sets
